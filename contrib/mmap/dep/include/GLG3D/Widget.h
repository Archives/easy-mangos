/**
 Interface for 2D or 3D objects that experience standard
 virtual world events and are rendered.

 Widget is an interface for "widget"-like objects.  You could think
 of it as a bare-bones scene graph.

 Modules are objects like the G3D::FirstPersonController,
 G3D::GConsole, and debug text overlay that need to receive almost the
 same set of events (onXXX methods) as GApp and that you would like
 to be called from the corresponding methods of a GApp.  They are a
 way to break large pieces of functionality for UI and debugging off
 so that they can be mixed and matched.
