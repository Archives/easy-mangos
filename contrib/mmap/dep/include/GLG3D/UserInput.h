 User input class that consolidates joystick, keyboard, and mouse input.

 Four axes are supported directly: joystick/keyboard x and y and 
 mouse x and y.  Mouse buttons, joystick buttons, and keyboard keys
 can all be used as generic buttons.

 Call beginEvents() immediately before your SDL event handling routine and hand
 events to processEvent() as they become available.  Call endEvents() immediately
 after the loop.
